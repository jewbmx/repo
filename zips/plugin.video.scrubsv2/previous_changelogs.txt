[B][COLOR orange]Previous Log Info[/COLOR][/B]

[B]- 5.1.11[/B] Flipped the previous_changelogs file to be latest changes first and a gap inbetween em. Removed some dead/dud scrapers. Changed client.py a bit and broke it down then swapped to a new modified request def. Also swapped the entire addon back to client.request use.(Old module saved in the addon for now as client_old.) Updated my host type of code to match resolveurls last update.(Had little tricks coded that were not needed now.)

[B]- 5.1.09-5.1.10[/B] Made a scraper, pulled a few others out that were not working. Added some defs to a few modules. Changed some code for TVpassport and Sky Channels to make em work better/faster.

[B]- 5.1.08[/B] Swapped a little of my new code around to fix a issue with page scrapes i seen coming lol. Also tossed one bad scraper in the blockage folder. Went ahead and blocked rabbitstream.net and dokicloud.one hosts. (the new host setting can enable them again.)

[B]- 5.1.06-5.1.07[/B] Made some changelog changes to be cleaner and added a new option in Tools for it. Changed source list a little so providers _ is replaced with . that way it looks a bit better, and i also made the host label show the full domain instead of just the first chunk :). Added a label change for the sources info bit too that now checks if there is info before adding the extra line for info.(not easily noticed besides a random | when the label rolls.) Fixed a fanart.tv issue with tvshows someone found. Made a setting to not block valid hosts that dont work for me. (incase they will work for others.) Did a bunch of other changes/fixes in various places but too much to type lmao.(Mostly regarding providers, sources, hosts, and whatnot.)

[B]- 5.1.05[/B] Changed getProviderDomains a little by moving it up in DevTools to look cleaner, also added a little list space and each scrapers last 3 domains. Added a little code to sort sources list by providers before the dupe check. (pretty much just a useless line of code that makes me happy, but also sorta means the first link found will be the one shown and all dupes after are whats filtered out.) Renamed the scrapers/providers to match their current domain as of now but the . is a _ lol.(Updated the settings to match which will likely wipe any related user settings and be default.) Modified the dupe checker code a little so it will ignore http/https differences.

[B]- 5.1.04[/B] Changed the trailer code a bit so you can change the source setting then click trailer again and have it swap without issues. (it was being set in each item while its made. now its set on action.) Made a new def and menu item called getProviderDomains plus a textViewer2 duped def coded to just be text instead of for file use.(I tossed this all in just so the scrapers url used can be seen easily. the menu items under DevTools. Be Aware that it wont show the scrapers in my "broken" folder.) Made some new scrapers(20ish) and updated the rest a bit. Also updated and resorted the provider settings to account for the new scrapers. Might of done some other stuff but dont remember because im always high :).

[B]- 5.1.01-5.1.03[/B] Made some scrapers and updated some others. Cleaned up a little log code i left in to test the MyFavorites. Changed the code for aliases a bit to include all titles gathered at once instead of coding them in each scraper. Updated some cleantitle code that Host505 used which fixes a odd debug log line. Added in a infotagger module made by jurialmunkey for the new listItem changes in kodi v20.(if you use older versions of kodi tell me if you spot any issues.) Also tweaked some various code for item data like item genres and whatnot.

[B]- 5.1.00[/B] Fixed imdb a bit. Added, fixed, or made some scrapers and cleaned up a bit. Added in some old favorites code labeled MyFavorites and did a bit of rework for it. (Now you can make and edit a quick easy saved list of shows or movies yet another way lol.) Might of done more stuff but cant recall.

[B]- 5.0.34[/B] Made a couple new settings for notifcations/infoDialogs found in the Dev'ish Settings tab. This is just a quick update to help yall out during the trakt downtime and to shut yall up too lol.

[B]- 5.0.33[/B] Made a trailers.to scraper for a user. (not fully tested so some results might fail.) Added some old code to cock block douche bags like the shadow addon from leaching off scrubs. (added it in sloppy compared to before so might run a bit slower lol.)

[B]- 5.0.32[/B] Fixed the random episode option for "WatchOnline: DoctorWho".(Also decided not to add back any of their other 70ish sites.) Tossed in my xemovies and realtalksociety scrapers. added a timeout to the primewiremn scraper code to reduce hangtime for users that havent disabled it yet. Added a setting called "Show Items Without Year/AirDate"(defaults false.) to help someone out and so yall can enjoy it too. (useful for Anticipated sections.)

[B]- 5.0.31[/B] Updated some artwork code in the last update for tv shows where no artwork found wasnt showing the default pic for it.(addon fanart) Cleaned up TVpassport Channels a little by ditching some channels and whatnot. Added back a newish version of "WatchOnline" for DoctorWho so someone can watch the new special they released.

[B]- 5.0.30[/B] Updated the addon fanart for both themes. Made a new Indexer/Menu Section called "TVpassport Channels" which is a daily list of movies that air on a chosen channel. (Similar to "Sky Channels" Menu Section.)

[B]- 5.0.29[/B] Changed the artwork code and url for TMDb artwork back to the fixed size style to reduce the sizes. (original is just too bulky lol.) Added in filepursuit for a user. (Contact me about any changes or issues you have for this as i do not use it.)

[B]- 5.0.28[/B] Modified the addon so script.scrubsv2.artwork is a Optional Install with it in that menu section, a popup to install on first runs like fresh installs and updates, plus a setting to disable the popup if the artwork isnt installed. (All of this should be unused code and not seen when the artwork is installed.) Recoded all the scrapers to use the match alias and match year defs for better results. (hopefully lol) Also did a full scraper check/cleanup and added some quality scrapes where possible. (likely not accurate lol.)

[B]- 5.0.27[/B] Moved all iptv content to my Json IPTV addon, then added a shortcut for it in the More Stuff and Optional Installs sections. Modified/Fixed a couple scrapers for someone.

[B]- 5.0.26[/B] Modified the episode code for some more scrapers to try improving the proper episode sources. Made a little match_year def to improve the year check in scrapers.

[B]- 5.0.25[/B] Fixed a error i made in the settings with a symbol lol and also modified the episode code for the 123moviesfree scraper to try improving the proper episode sources.

[B]- 5.0.24[/B] Added a new setting to toggle the &/and replacement for item titles. (so you can search for like Law and Order or Law & Order)  Applied some changes to the main.py with a new system.router process, was a suggested change but not sure of its pros/cons. (Doesnt seem any slower of faster to me but will swap it back if anyone wants.) Fixed some 2embed code for sources. Updated my custom host swaps for dood to fix the 4 known bad domains. Added support for ronemo.com sources if any are found. (rocdn.net is the host shown from my test item.) Updated, fixed, or made some scrapers and updated the settings for em all.

[B]- 5.0.23[/B] Changed up the "Episodes (Widget)" and its setting, everyone probably needs to update this now on their devices. Added another site for iptv stuff called "WatchYourTV". Removed the IPTV items i been working on like the canada list, its all now in its own addon called plugin.video.json_iptv i tossed together for testing. Updated the url for the youtube addon play code which is used for trailers.(Might cause problems with kodi versions below v18 or v19.) Made a couple scrapers and fixed some while doing a cleanup of em.

[B]- 5.0.22[/B] Fixed a little trakt code that was making some userlists error out. Removed "Watch [Show] Online" and "ShadowNet" from the More Stuff section because they both suck now and im not interested in fixing them up lol.

[B]- 5.0.21[/B] Made a slight change to my text cleaning code to hopefully fix name issues when loading userlists and other stuff, mainly used for title stuff. Did a quick scraper cleanup.

[B]- 5.0.18[/B] Changed some stuff in the ShadowNet section to try and improve it, removed artwork also since it didnt load properly anyways. Removed most of my forced cookie code from the scrapers to improve scrape time, if there are errors due to this change i will deal with them later lol. Also removed the debrid warning popup i tossed in a while back since i added the limited use option.(someone will have to tell me if that even works lol.)

[B]- 5.0.17[/B] Updated some settings. Modified some Trakt code with some of host505's changes.(for speed testing but speed doesnt seem to change.) Fixed a odd error from some items not scraped properly.(only fixes half the problem.) Made and added some new scrapers while updating or fixing others.(plus some anime/toon ones.) Added a setting under Accounts for resolveurl called "Resolve With Debrid".(Not tested but might be useful to debrid folks.) Added a new iptv site called WatchNewsLive which is pretty much a clone of the other two ustv sites/sections. Also Added a nice new iptv site/section called ShadowNet.(My tests had 720p streams.)

[B]- 5.0.16[/B] Light changes to the source domain stuff. (Added some code for membed use, Removed custom code for dood.) Did some other changes. (like Trakt Progress limit to 100 items.)

[B]- 5.0.12[/B] Ditched the myvideolinks scraper/provider due to its faulty search. refined the quality coding a bit more to reduce the fake 4k's.

[B]- 5.0.11[/B] finished the new "Watch [Show] Online" section in More Stuff. Added in a new scraper i made.(watchserieshdstream) Made and added in a new iptv indexer for UStvGO.(So far.)(Some channels fail to find the link which makes my new random channel option suck a little but enjoy anyways lol.)

[B]- 5.0.10[/B] small text adjustment in the settings. tossed the debug tools into cleantools_widget when the dev settings enabled. Fixed a couple more missed label errors for kodi 18.
